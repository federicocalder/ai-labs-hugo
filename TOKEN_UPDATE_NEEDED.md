# GitHub Token Update Required

## Issue:
Your current GitHub Personal Access Token doesn't have `workflow` scope permissions.

## Solution:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. Find your existing token for ai-labs-hugo

3. Click "Edit" or create a new token

4. Make sure these scopes are checked:
   ✅ repo (full repository access)
   ✅ workflow (update GitHub Actions workflows)
   ✅ write:packages (if needed)

5. Copy the new token

6. Update the token in your local Git config or environment

## Alternative: Push without workflow first

We can push the cleaned repository first, then add the workflow file separately through GitHub web interface.

## Next Steps:

After updating token permissions, run:
```bash
git push origin main
```

This will trigger the first automated deployment!
