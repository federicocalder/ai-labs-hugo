<p><em>Last updated: 13 September 2025</em></p>
<p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of the services and software provided by AI Labs and AI Labs powered by Grand Prix (collectively &ldquo;AI Labs,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). AI Labs is a brand operated by Grand Prix LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, with a principal place of business at 8275 S Eastern Ave #200, Las Vegas, NV 89123.</p>
<p>By accessing or using our website (<a href="https://www.ailabs.systems">https://www.ailabs.systems</a>) or any AI Labs products or services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use our services.</p>
<h2 id="1-acceptance-of-terms">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>Your use of AI Labs services constitutes acceptance of these Terms and forms a legally binding contract. If you use our services on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you warrant that you have authority to bind that entity. We may amend these Terms at any time by posting an updated version on our website and notifying you of material changes. Continued use after changes are posted constitutes acceptance.</p>
<h2 id="2-services-provided">2. Services Provided</h2>
<p>AI Labs provides digital services including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/">AI‑driven automation</a> consulting and done‑for‑you AI content generation;</li>
<li><a href="/">Marketing automation</a> tools (SaaS) delivered via web portals and APIs;</li>
<li>Real‑estate and mortgage marketing automation systems designed for industry compliance;</li>
<li>Digital downloads, SaaS platform access, and consulting sessions delivered electronically.</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that AI Labs will not offer free trials and that subscription terms, high‑ticket packages and custom projects may vary by contract. Payment obligations and billing cycles will be outlined in your specific order form or service agreement.</p>
<h2 id="3-account-registration-and-customer-responsibilities">3. Account Registration and Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<p>You must provide accurate, current, and complete information when registering for an account and keep it updated. You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and all activity occurring under your account. You agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay all fees when due and ensure payment methods are valid;</li>
<li>Communicate promptly and supply any data reasonably required for implementation;</li>
<li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including real estate and mortgage regulations); and</li>
<li>Refrain from misusing our services or infringing on third‑party rights.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-payments-billing-and-refunds">4. Payments, Billing and Refunds</h2>
<p>Most AI Labs services involve recurring monthly subscriptions or custom project fees. Fees, payment methods and billing cycles will be stated in your order form. Payment is typically required up‑front; certain services may allow deposits or down payments as specified in your contract. We accept major credit cards, PayPal and wire transfers.</p>
<p>Per industry guidance, a SaaS agreement should clearly describe fees, billing schedules, accepted payment methods and refund terms. Accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>No refunds will be provided for automation products once delivered.</li>
<li>If you miss a payment or a charge is disputed and not resolved, AI Labs may suspend or terminate services after 30 days of non‑payment.</li>
<li>Continued access to recurring services requires timely payment; we reserve the right to charge late fees or interest allowed by Nevada law.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-service-termination-and-suspension">5. Service Termination and Suspension</h2>
<p>Either party may cancel services at any time by providing written notice. If you cancel, automation and subscription services will cease immediately. If AI Labs cancels for breach of these Terms (including non‑payment or misuse), your services will be terminated, and unpaid fees will remain due. You acknowledge that, because our services are digital and tailored, fees are non‑refundable.</p>
<p>There is no minimum term commitment. However, termination does not relieve you of the obligation to pay accrued fees and interest.</p>
<h2 id="6-intellectual-property-and-licensing">6. Intellectual Property and Licensing</h2>
<p>AI Labs retains all intellectual‑property rights in its software, automations, content, and trademarks. Subject to your compliance with these Terms and payment of fees, AI Labs grants you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use the services for your internal business purposes. You may not reverse engineer, resell, sublicense, or publicly distribute our software or content.</p>
<h2 id="7-prohibited-uses">7. Prohibited Uses</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use AI Labs services for any unlawful or fraudulent purpose;</li>
<li>Impersonate another person or misrepresent your affiliation with an entity;</li>
<li>Violate, or encourage others to violate, applicable laws (including real estate and mortgage marketing rules);</li>
<li>Upload harmful code or interfere with the operation of our systems;</li>
<li>Use our services to transmit spam or unauthorized advertising; or</li>
<li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our servers or networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may investigate any violation of this section and take appropriate legal action.</p>
<h2 id="8-data-and-privacy">8. Data and Privacy</h2>
<p>Our collection and use of personal data is governed by our Privacy Policy below. You consent to the collection, storage and processing of personal data as described. AI Labs may use aggregated or anonymized data derived from your use of the services for analytics and improvements.</p>
<h2 id="9-thirdparty-services-and-links">9. Third‑Party Services and Links</h2>
<p>Our services may integrate with or link to third‑party tools (such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel). We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices or performance of third‑party services. Your use of any third‑party service is subject to that provider&rsquo;s own terms.</p>
<h2 id="10-disclaimers-of-warranties">10. Disclaimers of Warranties</h2>
<p>AI Labs provides its services on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. We do not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.</p>
<p>Disclaimer‑of‑warranty clauses are common in SaaS agreements and help limit liability for service interruptions.</p>
<h2 id="11-limitation-of-liability">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, AI Labs and its affiliates shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the services. Our total liability to you for any claim shall not exceed the total fees you paid to AI Labs in the 90 days preceding the event that gave rise to the claim. Including a liability cap is standard practice in SaaS Terms of Service.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for lost revenue or data breaches caused by third‑party system failures or any use outside of your authorized scope. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages; in such cases, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2 id="12-indemnification">12. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold AI Labs and its affiliates harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of your misuse of the services or violation of these Terms, including costs and attorney fees.</p>
<h2 id="13-governing-law-and-dispute-resolution">13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to conflict of law principles. All disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the services shall first be submitted to binding arbitration in Clark County, Nevada. Arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The prevailing party is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees and costs.</p>
<p>If arbitration is not permitted or enforceable, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in Clark County, Nevada. Nothing prevents either party from seeking injunctive relief in court to prevent imminent harm.</p>
<h2 id="14-changes-to-the-terms">14. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>We may modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or via a notice on our website. Updated Terms take effect upon posting unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically.</p>
<h2 id="15-force-majeure">15. Force Majeure</h2>
<p>AI Labs shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance under these Terms which is due to fire, flood, earthquake, pandemic, government action, war, terrorism, invasion, epidemic, strikes, labor disputes, or other events that are beyond our reasonable control (&ldquo;Force Majeure Event&rdquo;).</p>
<p>During a Force Majeure Event, AI Labs will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize service disruption</li>
<li>Provide timely communication about expected service restoration</li>
<li>Not charge fees for periods of complete service unavailability exceeding 72 consecutive hours</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than 30 days, either party may terminate the affected services with written notice.</p>
<h2 id="16-miscellaneous">16. Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with any service agreement or order form, constitute the entire agreement between us.</li>
<li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign your rights or obligations without our written consent. We may assign this agreement in connection with a merger, sale, or other corporate transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any provision does not waive our rights under that provision.</li>
</ul>
