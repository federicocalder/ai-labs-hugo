<p>Consistent with best practices for SaaS privacy policies, we disclose the categories of personal information we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information: name, email address, telephone number and physical address.</li>

<h2 id="6-cookies-and-tracking-technologies">6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>Our website and SaaS platform use cookies and similar technologies to distinguish you from other users and analyze traffic.
