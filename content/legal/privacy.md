# AI Labs Privacy Policy

*Last updated: 13 September 2025*

This Privacy Policy explains how AI Labs, a brand of Grand Prix LLC, collects, uses, discloses and protects personal information when you visit our website or use our services. We are based in the United States and currently serve customers in the U.S. only. By using our services, you consent to the practices described in this Policy.

## 1. Types of Personal Data Collected

Consistent with best practices for SaaS privacy policies, we disclose the categories of personal information we collect:
- Contact information: name, email address, telephone number and physical address.
- Account data: username, password, service preferences and payment status.
- Billing information: billing address, payment method (e.g., encrypted credit card data via a secure payment processor); we do not store complete payment card numbers.
- Usage data: pages visited, features used, session duration, device information (IP address, browser type and version, operating system) and analytics data.
- Business data provided by clients: marketing content, real‑estate listings or other materials uploaded to deliver services.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive data such as social security numbers, health information, or biometric identifiers.

## 2. How We Collect Information

We collect personal data through:
- Information you provide directly: when you create an account, complete forms, communicate with us, or upload content.
- Automated means: cookies, tracking pixels and similar technologies used by our site and SaaS platform.
- Third‑party integrations: analytics services such as Google Analytics and advertising tools like Facebook Pixel.

## 3. Purpose of Data Collection

We use the collected information for legitimate business purposes, including:
- Providing and improving our [AI automation services](/) and SaaS platform;
- Processing orders, invoicing, and managing accounts;
- Communicating with clients about updates, billing and support;
- Analyzing usage to enhance performance, security and user experience;
- Marketing our services, subject to applicable law; and
- Complying with legal obligations, industry regulations (e.g., real estate and mortgage compliance) and our contractual commitments.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing

We process personal data on the following bases:
- Performance of a contract: to fulfill the services you requested;
- Legitimate interests: to improve our services, market related services, prevent fraud and ensure security;
- Consent: when you subscribe to marketing communications (you may withdraw at any time); and
- Compliance with legal obligations: such as tax laws or regulatory requirements.

## 5. Data Retention and Storage

We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes stated above and to comply with our legal obligations. A clear data‑retention clause should explain how long data is kept and where. Accordingly:
- We store account information and content until your account is deactivated and any outstanding obligations are settled.
- Usage data may be retained for analytics for up to 24 months.
- Billing records are retained for the period required by tax and accounting laws.
- We may anonymize or aggregate data for internal analysis; anonymized data may be retained indefinitely.

All data is stored on secure servers located in the United States, currently on Hetzner's Oregon data center, and is subject to our confidentiality and security protocols.

## 6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Our website and SaaS platform use cookies and similar technologies to distinguish you from other users and analyze traffic. These may include session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which remain until removed). Cookies help us understand how our services are used.

We use first‑party cookies for authentication and preferences and third‑party cookies from Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel to measure performance and deliver relevant advertising. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies or notify you when cookies are being set; however, some features may not function properly without cookies.

## 7. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Data

We do not sell personal information to third parties. We share personal data only with:
- Service providers that process payments, host data, provide analytics or support services, and are contractually bound to protect your information;
- Affiliated entities within Grand Prix LLC for internal administrative purposes;
- Legal authorities if required by law or to protect our rights, property or safety;
- Successors in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, provided that the acquirer agrees to honor this Privacy Policy.

We do not intentionally transfer data outside the United States. If we must transfer personal data to another jurisdiction, we will use appropriate safeguards.
